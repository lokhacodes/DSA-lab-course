A[0] =3 
A[1] =28 
A[2] =15 
A[3] =5 
A[4] =11 
A[5] =17



2. Delete an item from an index. 
Sample input: 
Enter the index: 3 
3 
28 
5 
11

Output: Array is: 
A[0] =3 
A[1] =28 
A[2] =5 
A[3] =17



3. You are searching for a book in the library. Here our sorted list is the well-arranged n number of books according to unique numbers in ascending order in a shelf. Our target element is the book we prefer to read (Find the index of our desired book id assuming the 1st book is in 0 index) 
Sample Input: 
No. of book ids: 5 
Book IDs: 101, 102, 307, 401, 405 
Find the index of Book id: 102 
Output: 
The 102 book is in 1 index.
4. Find out the index of a given value and delete the item from the array. 
Sample input: 
Enter the values of array: 
3 
28 
5 
11 
17 
Enter the value: 11
Output: 
The index is 3 
Array is: 
A[0] =3 
A[1] =28 
A[2] =5 
A[3] =17



Bonus: (For classwork, for lab report you must submit it) 
5. Find the 3rd odd value of an array and delete it. 
Sample input: 
Enter the values of array: 
3 
28 
36 
11 
17
Output: 
The index of the 2nd odd value is 3 Array is: 
A[0] =3 
A[1] =28 
A[2] =36 
A[3] =17



6. Find the odd indexes of an array and insert value in front of each of the indexes.
Sample input: 
Enter the values of array: 
3 
36 
11 
17 
Enter values before even indices: 13 6
Output: 
Array is: 
A[0] =13 
A[1] =3 
A[2] =6 
A[3] =36 
A[4]=6 
A[5]=17
