Topic: Array

1. Suppose you are attending P.E class in school. You made a line randomly of n numbers of
students. The teacher then instructed you to stand in a line according to your height in
ascending order. Here input will be the height of the students and output will be the sorted
height of the students.
Sample Input:
Number of students 5
Heights: 4.8, 5.1, 6, 5.5, 4.9
Output:
4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.5, 6
2. You are searching for a book in the library. Here our sorted list is the well-arranged n
number of books according to unique numbers in ascending order in a shelf. Our target
element is the book we prefer to read (Find the index of our desired book id assuming the 1st
book is in 0 index)
Sample Input:
No. of book ids: 5
Book IDs: 101, 102, 307, 401, 405
Find the index of Book id: 102
Output:
The 102 book is in 1 index.
3. Suppose you will give a class test today. You were seated randomly as usual. Then the
faculty asked you to sit according to the at most 2 digits of your id in ascending order in a
single row. Find out the seat number of a given id.
Sample input:
Number of Students 5
Before seat arrangement:
A[1]= 12 A[2]= 19 A[3]=16 A[4]=5 A[5]=21
Find out bench no. of id: 5
Output:
After seat arrangement:
A[1]= 5 A[2]= 10 A[3]=12 A[4]=16 A[5]=21
Bench no. of id 5 is: 1

4. Find out the index of mth largest value in an array of n elements.
Bonus: Insert a value in that index.

Sample input:
No. of elements: 5
Enter m: 3
Array is:
A[1]= 22 A[2]= 19 A[3]=16 A[4]=5 A[5]=21
Bonus: Enter the value you want to insert: 15
Output:
The index of 3rd largest value is 19
Index of 19 is 2
Bonus: After insertion of 15 the array is:
A[1]= 22 A[2]= 15 A[3]=19 A[4]=16
