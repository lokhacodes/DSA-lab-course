3 
28 
5 
11 
16
Output: Array is: 
A[0] =3 
A[2] =5 
A[4] =16



4. Write a program in C to find the sum of all elements of the array of N elements.

3 
28 
5 
11 
16
Output: 
Average of 5 elements is 12.6



6. Write a program in C to copy the elements of one array into another array.
Sample input: 
Enter no. of elements: 3 
3 
28 
5
Output: 
One array is: 
A[0] =3 
A[1] =28 
A[2] =5 
Another array is: 
B[0] =3 
B[1] =28 
B[2] =5



7. Write a program in C to find out the maximum value from the elements of one array.

3 
28 
5 
11 
16
Output: 
Maximum value among 5 elements is 28



8. Find out the intersection values of 2 arrays.
